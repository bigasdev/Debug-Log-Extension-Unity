# Debug-Log-Extension-Unity

This script creates the Log namespace, ill be using it to make some debugs easier (position, missed component/reference, boolean checks, etc) so i can have a nice and easy to read template to debug stuff.

It's a simple project for my own use, feel free to add more stuff to it!
